I write and maintain a number of applications, open-source frameworks and hacky side-projects, all of which can be found here.

## Apps

These projects have made it to the revered "Apps" category, which means I consider them stable and useful enough to be used by everyone. With the exception of Teleport: AddOns, all of them are open-source and can be found on my [GitHub](http://github.com/iKenndac) account.

### Couch Slouch

<img class="left no-border" src="{{ root_url }}/apps/couch-slouch.png">

A Mac OS X application that allows your TV's remote to control your Mac, and can also have your Mac and AV system react to one another — whether it’s having your Mac wake up when you switch on your TV or having your TV and AV receiver switch off when your Mac goes to sleep. 

More info at [couch-slouch.com](http://couch-slouch.com/). 

### Teleport: AddOns

<img class="left no-border" src="{{ root_url }}/apps/teleport-addons.png">

If you play World of Warcraft on more than one computer, you'll have run into problems keeping your setup just how you like it. Sure, World of Warcraft syncs its own settings, but not your AddOns or their settings.

Enter Teleport: AddOns, a free program for Mac OS X and Windows that syncs your AddOns and their settings via Dropbox or an external hard drive or USB stick — with more sync sources coming soon. Whether you play World of Warcraft on your Mac or PC (or both!) Teleport: AddOns has you covered.

Available for Mac and Windows coming soon. Download Teleport: AddOns for Mac [here](/apps/files/TeleportAddOns.zip). 

### ProShutdown

<img class="left no-border" src="{{ root_url }}/apps/proshutdown.png">

Mac OS X has a nifty shortcut - Ctrl+Eject - for shutting down your computer. On older Apple keyboards, these keys are on opposite diagonal corners of the keyboard, and at the end of the day you can simply hit the two corners of the keyboard then Return to switch off your computer. However, with the new Apple Aluminium Keyboard, the eject key is in the middle of the top row of keys - hardly as convenient! Instead, F19 takes the top right spot.

ProShutdown is a free program that restores the "opposite corners" shortcuts by listening for Ctrl+F19 and friends, and displaying a shut down dialog when these are pressed. It displays a small (removable) "F19" icon in the menu bar to remind you that this shortcut is available. 

Download ProShutdown [here](/apps/files/ProShutdown.dmg).

### Timelapse for Aperture

<img class="left no-border" src="{{ root_url }}/apps/aperture-plugin.png">

Timelapse for Aperture is a dead-simple Aperture Export plugin that creates video directly from your Aperture library — simply export your photos using "Time Lapse…" in Aperture and you’ll have a video suitable for editing in your favourite video editor in no time.

This plugin requires that Aperture is running in 64-bit mode.

Download Timelapse for Aperture [here](/apps/files/TimelapseForApertureInstaller.zip).

### 500px Aperture Uploader

<img class="left no-border" src="{{ root_url }}/apps/aperture-plugin.png">

An Aperture export plugin for uploading your photos straight to the popular [500px](http://500px.com) photography site. The plugin allows you set the name, tags, description and category of each photo, as well as optionally marking them as private. This metadata, as well as the URL of the photo on 500px, is saved back to your photo in Aperture so you'll always know where your photos are.

This plugin requires that Aperture is running in 64-bit mode.

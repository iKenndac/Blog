As my previous post may have indicated, I fly quite a bit.
Unfortunately, this has dulled me to the wonder of it a bit. When I do
go flying, I sit in my seat and think about how annoying the other
passengers are and how crappy the food is, when in reality I should be
looking out of the window and thinking how amazing it is that 160 tonnes
of metal is managing to defy gravity and fly myself, a hundred smelly
people and their luggage hundreds of miles to a far off land. Outside
the plane, though, I'm different. I regularly cause pile-ups
((dramatisation)) on the M25 near Heathrow as I watch the planes take
off and land as I go by. Once thing I particularly enjoy is the
difference between planes taking off and planes landing. A plane,
especially a large one, obviously hates being on the ground. For
starters, take a look at this plane taking off:

It almost looks as if it *wants* to take off, and is looking forward to
being up in the sky. When it's up there, it looks just like the picture
in my previous post - sleek and beautiful, soaring through the sky.
Finally, compare that picture to this:

Tethered, as if to a life support machine - unable to support itself
without hundreds of ancillary machines keeping it alive - it even has to
be pushed around by a little truck! Right, there is a point to this
post, despite several hundred words of rambling, and it begins... now.
Because of the fascination with planes detailed above, I've purposely
not been up in a light aircraft ((Not that is was hard - I just didn't
give someone a pile of money to take me up in one)). I imagined that,
just as driving an [Ariel Atom](http://www.arielmotor.co.uk/full_screen_v2.html) will a sense of
driving far greater and purer than lumbering along in a Volvo, the
experience of piloting a light aircraft and feeling the effect of every
slight movement you make on the controls and gust of wind will make me
fall in love with flying and want to learn. Learning, in case you
wondered, is very expensive. Unfortunately, Tim got me the very
wonderful present of a trip up in a light aircraft. Allow me to present
photos...

This would have been fine if after 10 minutes of looking at Cambridge
and the surrounding area the pilot didn't say "Ok, now it's your turn".
I would've happily enjoyed the experience, gone back home and wished I
could fly. I'd then look into it, discover how much it costs, and give
up. However, the pilot *did*, after 10 minutes of looking at Cambridge
and the surrounding area, say "Ok, now it's your turn". And, with hardly
any warning sirens at all, I successfully turned the little plane left
and right and made it go up and down. I looked down at a field and
couldn't quite see it properly, so I banked the plane a little so I
could see better. The experience was fascinating. I knew the theory
behind it all from reading books about planes and playing on Flight
Simulator, but in real life it's (obviously) much more direct - you feel
every little movement the plane makes as it's thrown around by the wind.
So, I want to learn. Allow me to present a thoroughly research cost
analysis of flying a light aircraft:

The costs are, in seriousness, quite absurd. A brand new Cessna Skyhawk
costs hundreds of thousands of pounds. Obviously, you don't buy brand
new planes - you buy used ones and/or share ownership or rent them. For
example, there's a 9 year old Skyhawk on eBay for a thoroughly
reasonable Â£89,999.00. Still, I'll make it happen. I don't plan to own a
'craft for a very long time, but I'll at least learn to fly one. Maybe
not this year, but soon.

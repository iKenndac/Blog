I have a girlfriend. I know, right? Anyway, back when we were living
miles away from each other, our primary methods of communication were
phone calls and text messages. Nowadays, we live together and
(obviously) see each other loads. This means the volume of calls and
texts to each other has dropped *drastically*, and now they're
essentially used for status updates of queries about shopping. The
quality (especially my side) of our communications via text has rapidly
tanked. Here, for your enjoyment, is a series of screen grabs from my
generic fruit-based phone. ![iPhone SMSes](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/smss1.gif "iPhone SMSes")

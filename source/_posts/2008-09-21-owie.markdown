I've been doing some bike riding since moving house, and I'm lucky to be
situated within riding distance of [Chick Sands](http://www.chicksandsbikepark.co.uk/). However, while watching
someone else and assuming that if I followed their path I wouldn't
crash, I... well, crashed. Artist's impression:

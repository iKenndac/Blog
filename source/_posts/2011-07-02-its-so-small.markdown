*That's what she said!*

I've always known that Stockholm is small compared to London. I mean,
the population of Greater London is more than 80% of the population of
the *entire* of Sweden. However, I didn't really realise *how* small it
is until I compared these two pictures I took. Obviously they're not
idea (visibility is greater in the Stockholm photo), but the London
urban sprawl does on for as far as the eye can see!

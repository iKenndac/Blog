I'm not patriotic about this country at all - at least not in a
traditional sense. I believe the you can't have a true democracy *and* a
monarchy (no matter how emblematic they are nowadays), and that while
the British Empire was once great, times have changed and we should move
on - public money can be spent on better things. What I am proud of this
country for, and I *truly* believe that makes this country great, is the
[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/). It puts all other television and radio to
shame - especially American TV. For a measly £135 a year, you get
unlimited *advert-free* access to arguably the best programming in the
world. What makes the BBC so great? It's because its *sole* purpose is
to make the best programming possible. Not to make a profit, not to
serve shareholders, and not to please advertisers. The BBC is bound by a
[charter](http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/charter/) that regulates it
- and that charter essentially states that the BBC exists to serve the
public. One particular thing I enjoy about it are the guidelines on
[impartiality](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/edguide/impariality/)
- something we Brits don't understand fully until we visit America and
experience some of the ["news"](http://www.foxnews.com/) channels there.
Anyway! The point of my post is that someone, very recently, was allowed
into the decision making seat at the BBC and managed to very seriously
screw up two of my favourite channels - BBC Three and BBC HD. **BBC
Three** BBC Three is pretty cool, and it had a very nice ident going on
- simple, but humorous. The idea is that little plastic 'blobs' act out
famous little clips from TV shows, films, etc, but with special ones for
special occasions (Glastonbury, for example). The little critters really
warmed on you! Here's a compilation of a few of them: ... the
Glastonbury one: ... and an official image: [![BBC Three ‘Blob’ Idents](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/bbcthreeold.jpg)](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/bbcthreeold.jpg "BBC Three ‘Blob’ Idents")
The recently had a rebrand, however - and now its all neon colours and
'hip' things. Not warming at all! [![BBC Three ‘Neon’ ident](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/bbcthreenew.jpg)](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/bbcthreenew.jpg "BBC Three ‘Neon’ ident")
I really don't like the new image at all. As we're going over to DVB,
perhaps they're changing the image to attract younger people as more and
more people can view these digital channels. Perhaps I'm just getting
too old to get what the kids are into these days? **BBC HD** Until very
recently, BBC HD has just been a 'test' channel, which means it doesn't
show a lot of stuff and is merely meant as a technical demo to convince
whoever regulates the BBC that its worth it ((Good news - they were
convinced, and BBC HD is becoming a full channel!)). [![BBC HD Logo](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hdlogo1.jpg)](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hdlogo1.jpg "BBC HD Logo")
This meant that the BBC pulled their sleeves up in the tech department.
The quality of the channel is amazing - far outpassing the efforts from
Sky HD et al - they broadcast in
[h.264](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H264) at a very high bitrate. For
the ident, they went all out. I can't find a video online, but the ident
starts with a swooshy thing: [![HD Ident 1](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hd1.jpg)](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hd1.jpg "HD Ident 1")
... which then explodes into a billion little glass pieces: [![HD Ident 2](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hd2.jpg)](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/hd2.jpg "HD Ident 2")
At the same time, it seems that there's a noise attached to each little
shard in surround sound space, so you can hear the shards going past and
around you. Now, they've overlaid horrible music on top. Booo! Bring
back the awesomeness! I'm so annoyed, I might even record the audio from
the old and new ones to demonstrate!

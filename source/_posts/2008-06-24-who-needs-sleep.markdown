Perhaps the most gruelling part of my job is when the workload starts to
pile up. Being at the top of the chain, as it were, means I can't
complain to my manager when I get too much pressure put on me - I just
have to man it up and put the work in. So, for the next few weeks I'll
be working 12 hour days. *Fun.* Still, we persevere. At least when this
is all over I'll have a new product out the door (money++) and be in a
nice big new house (money––) Then, I can take a week off work to sleep
it all off.

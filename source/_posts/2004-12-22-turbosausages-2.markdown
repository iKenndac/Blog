I own a nice [computer system](http://danielkennett.org/pictures/desk/finished.jpg) with a
[Wacom Intuos 3](http://www.wacom-europe.com/uk/products/intuos/intuos3_a5.asp)
graphics tablet, which is pretty sweet. Part of my computer's software
collection is a fantastic piece of art software called
[Painter](http://www.corel.com/painterix/home/index.html). So, what do I
do with this? Draw stupid stuff, that's what! Ok, so years ago in school
my friend Marcus and I invented "Turbosausages", which are sausages with
wheels and rocket boosters that little people drove about. Last year,
when I was bored in a lecture at University, I remembered about them and
drew a [few](http://danielkennett.org/turbo/). I now present
Turbosausages 2: In Colour!

![ClarusiPhone128.png](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ClarusiPhone128.png)Normally,
I write a "Postmortem"
[blog](http://www.kennettnet.co.uk/blog/comments/clarus-1.0-postmortem/)
[post](http://www.kennettnet.co.uk/blog/comments/music_rescue_4.0_postmortem/)
after each product I ship. However, recently I got the chance to give a
talk at [CocoaHeads Swindon](http://cocoaheads.org/uk/Swindon/index.html), and chose to talk
about my trials and tribulations when writing [Clarus for iPhone](http://itunes.com/app/Clarus) (iTunes Link). The other day it
struck me that this actually turned out to be a great postmortem, so
instead of writing a blog post I sat at my computer and recorded a video
of my slides and commentary. The talk goes through many aspects of
designing and building an iPhone companion app, from design to
implementation gotchas to non-coding issues such as whether you should
even bother with an app, how much it costs to do, and so on.

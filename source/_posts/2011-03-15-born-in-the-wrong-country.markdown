When we were driving through Sweden to catch the ferry to England the
other day, my fiancé and I were discussing what we'd think it'd be like
returning to the country we grew up in after living away from it for six
months. She was worried that she'd feel at home and not want to leave
again. I doubted I'd feel that way, but wasn't sure.

Boy, was I born in the wrong country. I've been here less than 48 hours
and I'm already counting the minutes before I can go home again.

This is the hardest thing in the world to describe, but England is…
dull. Not boring, but the colour palette seems to be muted. I thought I
was imagining things, but after chatting with a friend of mine back in
Sweden today, it seems I'm not alone. We share similar theories —
perhaps the significantly higher traffic levels make everything near the
roads dirty, or the higher pollution levels coupled with higher rainfall
covers everything in dirt, but there's a definite difference.

I miss the clear air. The modern communications infrastructure. Being
able to drive somewhere without joining a queue of traffic. The
inability for *anyone* in Sweden to comprehend why on Earth I'd move
there without a Swedish girlfriend or family member forcing me. Hell,
even the damn traffic lights.

I miss home.

I don't, however, miss the mosquitoes that'll be waiting when it gets
warmer. Little fuckers.

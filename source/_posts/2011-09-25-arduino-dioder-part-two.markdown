A couple of weeks ago, I [wrote a post](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2011/09/arduino-dioder-part-one/)
detailing the process of combining a set of colour-changing IKEA LED
strips, an Arduino, a few simple electronic components and a lot of
nerdiness into a project that allowed you to control the colour of the
LEDs though a simple application running on your computer.

Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be presenting cool things you can
do with this project here on my blog. However, I *was*planning on
working up to this post, but since lots of people were enthusiastic
about this particular part (as can be seen from the screenshot of my
Facebook stream to the right), I jumped ahead a bit.

Now, Philips have a very similar system in a lot of their TVs, and as a
colleague at work who called me "Mr. Patent Infringer" pointed out, they
probably have a buttload of patents covering their technology.

So, please allow me to present…

## An Ambient Lighting Solution Similar To But Legally Distinct From Philips® Ambilight®

So, what's the challenge here? Well, actually, the core challenge is
pretty damn simple:

1.  Sample the screen.
2.  Push an appropriate colour based on the edges of the screen image to
    the lights.

Philips' hardware also does a fuckton of image processing to smoothly
animate between colours and even provides an "aggressiveness" setting to
control how sensitive the LEDs are to colour change. I'll be leaving
this as an exercise to the reader for now.

As always, all the code is available at the [project's home on GitHub](https://github.com/iKenndac/Arduino-Dioder-Playground).

### First Attempt: Who let \*him\* near a computer?

So, I'm not going to lie — my first attempt at this, was, well, lame.
For a start, I learned that if you leak a screen's worth of pixel data
every time the screen refreshes (that's 2560 x 1440 x 4 bytes = just
over 14Mb per frame at up to 60Hz), things go very bad very quickly.
Once that was fixed, my technique was:

1.  Register for screen update callbacks using
    `CGRegisterScreenRefreshCallback()`.
2.  Every time I got one of those, render the entire screen image into a
    new buffer.
3.  Loop through *all*of the pixels in the top, bottom, left and right
    1/4 rectangles of the image buffer.
4.  Average the RGB values therein.
5.  Push those to the Arduino.

As you might imagine, that method is rather inefficient. In fact, it's
downright idiotic, and took nearly 60% of my CPU *all the time.*

As the implementation matured, various optimisations of course took
place — only an idiot would allocate a new buffer each time the image
changes, for instance. In addition, the
`CGRegisterScreenRefreshCallback()` callback looks like this:

`void screenDidUpdate(CGRectCount count, const CGRect *rectArray, void
*userParameter);`

Which provides a lovely rect array telling you which parts of the screen
image changed, which is perfect since we only care about parts of the
image.

### Final Attempt: Passable, I guess

As I attempted to improve the efficiency of the project, I tried only
sampling every fourth pixel, scaling the image down, etc, since we
obviously don't need every single pixel sampled to get a single average
colour that's good enough for the lights. However, the very act of
rendering the screenshot into a pixel buffer was by far the most
intensive part of the whole thing. I was publicly fishing for help on
Twitter when @uliwitness reminded me that Core Image exists.

A few minutes later, I'd replaced 90% of my code with a call to a Core
Image Filter called CIAreaAverage, which calculates the average colour
of a given image. Since Core Image is badass and much better than me,
this actually causes all the work to be kept on the graphics card and
caused CPU usage to tumble.

The final project for this post contains two methods of calculating
colours:

**Pick A Pixel:** Literally pick a single pixel near each edge of the
screen and use that. Not very clever.

**Average RGB:** Use Core Image to calculate the average colour of the
edge rectangles of the scree as discussed above.

I was also planning on doing an Average Hue method too, since I was
expecting Average RGB to give brown every time (possibly a side-effect
of always getting shades of brown when mixing colours in art at school).
However, Average RGB works just fine so I never implemented it.

### Project Status

As of now ([commit b3a1b17c038458d498d551a18d120435daf9f778](https://github.com/iKenndac/Arduino-Dioder-Playground/commit/b3a1b17c038458d498d551a18d120435daf9f778)),
the project has undergone a few improvements since [Part 1](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2011/09/arduino-dioder-part-one/) of
this series:

-   Removed AMSerialPort for my own DKSerialPort class. AMSerialPort was
    buggy and didn't work with connection speeds over 9600 baud.
    DKSerialPort is also a lot smaller.
-   Created a class called ArduinoDioderCommunicationController, which
    abstracts away all the work of communicating with the Arduino
    running the included sketch. This allows future projects in this
    series (and you, of course) to drop in the class and just push
    colours without caring about how it all works.

Of course, I have to include a video of this project in action. The
colour changing is a little crappy since I don't do any smoothing, and
unfortunately my camera picked up an odd flickering which isn't visible
by the naked eye, but you get the idea:

### Moving Forward

As before, let me know [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/iKenndac) if
you'd like to share and thoughts or idea about this project. In a week
or two I'll put up another post discussing some more code to make the
LED strips respond to system events and so on.

I hope this is enough to get you started, though. Have fun!

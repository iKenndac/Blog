Sometimes, life decides to let up a bit and reward you for all your hard
work and graft. Friday was one of those days. After WWDC finished at
midday, a developer friend I met at the conference asked if I'd like to
accompany them on a trip back to the Apple campus in Cupertino and for a
tour of ILM. After I picked my jaw up from the floor, we were away in a
rental car. If you don't know (which I didn't until then),
[ILM](http://www.ilm.com/) (Industrial Light and Magic) is the company
that does the special effects for films like Star Wars, Jurassic and
various other Hollywood blockbusters.

*Part of the ILM campus*
We weren't allowed to take photos inside, but it was amazing in there.
We got to see various models that were used in films, including a fully
animatronic dinosaur. There was art everywhere, and we also got to see
inside some of the screening theatres. We saw a few full-size suits from
the Star Wards universe, including a Darth Vader and a Stormtrooper. The
best part was that we were were given the tour by a guy called
[David](http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&id=1808941569&cf=gen) who
actually works there, rather than a someone employed to give tours.
Thanks David!

After a brief stint across the Golden Gate bridge after taking a wrong
turn...

...we drove down to Cupertino. It was great to go back again and see the
campus in daylight, and I managed to go to the campus store and get some
goodies since the line was so long the night before.

I managed to get (deep breath): A cap, two t-shirts, two mugs, a
notepad, three pens, and a wireless Mighty Mouse. I'm such a corporate
whore! It's like the Poyntons and Porsche stuff... Anyway, we saw some
odd things around the campus, including a car with an ITMS (iTunes Music
Store) license plate...

...and Steve Jobs' car! Score! Notice it hasn't got a license plate -
people kept stealing so he got special permission to not have one.

On the way back to San Francisco, we took Highway 1 - the [Pacific Highway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1). It's a
beautiful stretch of road that runs along the west coast of America for
over 500 miles. We just had to stop for a couple of photos!

**Interesting Tidbits** I'd like to give a big thank you to Jeremy and
Adam for a great day. Star Wars and the Apple campus - a bit of a nerd's
day out!

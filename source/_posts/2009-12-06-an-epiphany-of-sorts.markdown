My comprehension of music as something that could connect with you
emotionally came fairly late in my childhood. In 1997, at the age of
twelve, I received a little CD player/radio and a copy of [Now! 38](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_That's_What_I_Call_Music!_38_(UK_series))
on CD. For a while, I didn't really buy much music, other than a couple
of singles here and there.

### In The Beginning

In 1999, I discovered two bands that remain at the core of my love of
music today — [Counting Crows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_Crows) and [Barenaked Ladies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barenaked_ladies). I can't actually
remember how I found Barenaked Ladies, but I heard a Counting Crows
track (Hangin' Around) playing in the local branch of the now-defunct
[MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_Video_Club) and bought it
there and then. Those two bands changed the way I perceive music.
Counting Crows especially is a band whose music can make you laugh, cry
and everything in between if you're in the right place. In time, I
started to reject any band whose music I couldn't 'connect' with, and my
discography was very small.

### Hitting the Mainstream

When I started my second year of University, things changed somewhat.
For the first time in my life, I was living alone, and did so for nearly
three years. This meant I had music playing almost literally *all* the
time. My limited discography wasn't really up to it, so I ended up
listening to [BBC Radio 1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/) a lot of the
time. As a result, I absorbed a lot of "mainstream" and pop music
through the osmosis that occurs when you're working with music on in the
background. I learned very quickly that listening to bands like Counting
Crows and Barenaked Ladies while trying to work is a futile effort — you
spend all your time thinking about the music you're hearing rather than
actually working. As a result, I started buying the odd pop single here
and there for those occasions I wanted to listen to something that keeps
my head empty. "Those songs don't have any lasting value! What's the
point in buying them?" a friend of mine said, missing both the point of
my purchases and the irony of making that statement about digital
content. For a long time I purchased songs by these groups with the
reasoning that they make good "programming" songs — empty of soul, but
catchy and pleasing to listen to nonetheless. The idea that you have to
emotionally connect with music for it to be "good" still reigning
supreme, and a group of women singing through an autotuner about having
a one night stand simply doesn't cut it.

### Times-A-Changin'

Over the past year, several things have happening to radically alter how
I perceive music. Some of them that particularly stand out: **I've spent
a lot less time** with some of my friends who, much as I love them, are
music snobs. Any music that isn't within their definition of what's good
is automatically deemed rubbish and/or stupid, and therefore not worthy
of being called "music". The phrase "I only like *real* music" is common
here. **I've actually paid attention to what's being said** in a lot of
these songs, especially by those I recognise as being talented but
outside my preferred genres. For example, I used to think that "rappers"
are stuck-up egotistical idiots, but listening to Timbaland's *The Way I
Are* makes it clear that at least the people behind that song are having
fun and not taking it particularly seriously. **I've started playing a
game** with my girlfriend where we take a stupid, shallow-sounding lyric
and attempted to discuss the meaning behind it as if we were reviewing a
play. In many more instances than I could've imagined, the lyrics aren't
actually as shallow or stupid as they seem. The game goes as follows:
When a song comes on the radio that you don't particularly know or care
the meaning of, take a chorus lyric and discuss. For example, given the
following lyric: *I'd give it all up just for you, just to have you near
me...* I asked the question "Is she saying that she'll drop her life,
job and friends for this guy, or just drop her pants?" Given the context
of the rest of the song, in this case the singer is talking about giving
up her existing life in order to be with the man she loves.

### By God, He's Got It!

Very recently, this has all "clicked". Girls Aloud don't just make good
"programming" music, they make good Pop music. The statements "My
favourite band is Counting Crows" and "I really like Girls Aloud" are,
in fact, absolutely compatible. Buying "She Wolf" by Shakira because the
"Arrroooooo!" in the chorus makes you laugh is also absolutely fine. All
of a sudden, I'm enjoying music a lot more. Listening to, say, Talylor
Swift's album is no longer a guilty pleasure — it's simply a pleasure.
I've not lost touch with the connection to music from bands like
Counting Crows can give, it's just that I seem to have finally learned
that there's a place for all genres of music no matter how "deep" it may
be. Except heavy metal. God, how I hate heavy metal.

This is the song that broke my preconceptions about rappers being
stuck-up idiots. Especially the lines "I ain't got a motorboat, but I
can float your boat" and "Your body ain't Pamela Anderson's, it's a
struggle just to get you in the caravan". Makes me laugh every time.

 Cheese-tastic, but the awfully half-hearted wolf howl in the chorus

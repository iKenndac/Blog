A few weeks ago, my friend came to visit me from the UK. He's quite the photography enthusiast, and while he was here he fell in love with my [Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L](http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-24-105mm-f-4-L-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx) lens. By the time we left for our road trip to the UK, he'd already ordered a similar lens and very kindly *gave* his Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens to my fianc√© since his new one would be replacing it.

Two days after we arrive in the UK, the lens my friend gave us stuck at 17mm and wouldn't budge. I felt super-bad about this, even though it turned out it was a [common problem](http://thydzik.com/canon-efs-17-85mm-is-stucklocked-zoom-repairdisassembly/) with this lens.

Still feeling bad about breaking my friend's lens, I dived right into the tutorial and tried to fix it! Lenses are incredibly intricate, and my first attempt wasn't so successful - I'd fixed the zoom sticking, but now the focus didn't work!

### Take Two ###

Tonight, I tried to fix it again, and was successful! The lens' zoom is a smooth as ever and the focus works too. I was ecstatic, and I looked down to see my dog staring at me with glee, raising his paw as if to say "HIGH FIVE bro, you tha man!"

A couple of seconds later I realised he was *actually* trying to say "Damnit I'm hungry - give me food!" Still pleased with my dexterity and skill, I went to the kitchen to distribute food for him and ended up with, well, a less than optimal result.

I guess there's no brain surgery in my future after all.

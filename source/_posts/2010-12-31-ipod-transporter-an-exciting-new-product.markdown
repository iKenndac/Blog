<p>Are you sick and tired of having your collection of nearly 20 test iPods for work cluttering up your desk, getting lost and broken?</p>
<p><em>Me too!</em></p>
<p>That's why I've come up with a revolutionary new product — the <strong>iPod Transporter</strong>!</p>
<p><a title="View 'iPod Transporter Front Quarter View' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24169642@N06/5309420645"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5309420645_9c22e54dd2_z.jpg" border="0" alt="iPod Transporter Front Quarter View" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>Using the iPod Transporter, you can store and transport your iPods and iPhones in speed and style!</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Equipped for Speed and Style</h3>
<p>iPod Transporter is outfitted with <em>two</em> motors, for unrivalled power and speed! In addition, the tracks are independently operated allowing iPod Transporter to turn a full circle on the spot!</p>

<h3>Built for Stability and Versatility</h3>
<p>Unlike <em>other</em> Lego-based iPod storage and transport solutions on the market, the iPod Transporter has its battery pack and motors as low as possible in the chassis, giving great stability during those high-speed turns — and the tracks allow it to traverse rough terrain with ease!</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>This isn't a real product. If you want to build one yourself, you're on your own! However, mine was built pretty much exclusively built with parts from the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=8275">Lego Motorised Bulldozer</a>.</p>

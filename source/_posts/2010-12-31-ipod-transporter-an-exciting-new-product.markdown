Are you sick and tired of having your collection of nearly 20 test iPods
for work cluttering up your desk, getting lost and broken?

*Me too!*

That's why I've come up with a revolutionary new product — the **iPod
Transporter**!

Using the iPod Transporter, you can store and transport your iPods and
iPhones in speed and style!

## Features

### Equipped for Speed and Style

iPod Transporter is outfitted with *two* motors, for unrivalled power
and speed! In addition, the tracks are independently operated allowing
iPod Transporter to turn a full circle on the spot!

### Built for Stability and Versatility

Unlike *other* Lego-based iPod storage and transport solutions on the
market, the iPod Transporter has its battery pack and motors as low as
possible in the chassis, giving great stability during those high-speed
turns — and the tracks allow it to traverse rough terrain with ease!

### Built-In iPod Dock and Cable Management

Sick and tired of losing your iPod cables and docks? With its built-in
Universal Dock, iPod Transporter makes that problem a thing of the past.
Simply drive your iPod Transporter up to the computer of choice, plug it
into a spare USB port and place your chosen device into the built-in
Dock.

sofa! iPod Transporter is equipped with an innovative storage solution

extend the pouch, place your iPods inside and safely stow it away again.

### Disclaimer

This isn't a real product. If you want to build one yourself, you're on
your own! However, mine was built pretty much exclusively built with
parts from the [Lego Motorised Bulldozer](http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=8275).

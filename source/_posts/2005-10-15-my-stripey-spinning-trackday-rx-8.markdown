**Note: For the videos below, you need the latest version of
[QuickTime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/).** Ok, so if you
buy an RX-8 in the UK, you get a free trackday type thing. I went on
mine not long ago, and it's awesome. You do 5 things: - Road driving.
Sounds boring, but was amazing - you go out for a couple of hours with
an advanced driving instructor. Mine was also a traffic cop! You get
taught all sorts of cool stuff, like how to balance the car properly
though corners, how to negotiate roundabouts, etc, smoothly and quickly.
Amazing stuff. - Track driving. A different instructor then takes you
round a high-speed race track, teaching you racing lines, etc. - ABS.
Simple exercises showing you how ABS works, emergency stopping from 80+
mph, etc. - Adverse handling. Imagine the twistiest, bumpiest road you
can imagine. Then imagine tearing around it as fast as you possibly can.
Absolutely the most fun I've ever had in a car:

First video is of me driving, taken from the back seat. You can hear my
instructor telling me what to do, etc. Sorry that it's shaky - the
course was very, very bumpy.

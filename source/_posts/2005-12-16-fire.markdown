On Sunday, December 11th an explosion then a several day long fire hit a
oil depot near here. There's been plenty of news coverage about it, and
I'm sure you've seen many videos about the direct impacts of the
incident. On the day, we decided to take my video camera and have a
scout round the area to see what effects the incident had slightly
further afield. I'm sure this isn't as important and shocking as the
images of burnt out cars, destroyed buildings and houses with missing
roofs you'll see, but it's interesting nonetheless.

are two videos, and both require [QuickTime 7](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/). Please right-click the
links and download them. They're a bit bigger than the screenshot above
- I had to shrink the player down to fit the picture on this page. If
you don't know who I am, and don't want to see clips of me and my
friends messing about, download the 5 min 30 sec long video
[here](http://danielkennett.org/pictures/hemelfire/hemeleffects.mov).
(34 Mb). If you *do* know who I am, or want to see my and my friends
messing around a bit, download the 7 min 40 sec long video

  **Disclaimer:** Don't e-mail me telling me that I'm being insensitive by posting us messing around and having fun in the same video that covers stuff about the fire. Nobody died and only two people were [seriously hurt](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4517962.stm), so I don't feel I'm doing anything wrong.

Ok, with that done with... On the video, you'll see a few amazing
things: Firstly, at 11am people are already panic-buying petrol, causing
massive queues all over the place. And this time, it genuinely *is*
panic buying - when it happened during the fuel strikes, it was
justified - we were running out of fuel, fast. The depot that went up in
flames only accounts for 5% of the UK's oil supply, and it's sudden loss
isn't going to cause pumps around the country to dry up.

got closer, we got under the smoke coming from the fire. It pretty much
blocked out the sun, and it was still frosty about at midday - and still
rather dark. We got as close as we could to the fire, which was about
1/2 a mile away. The police presence was amazing. Around the area, all
the bus-stops and lay-bys were coned off (usually with a police car
inside) to stop people stopping to look at the smoke. All roads that
went anywhere near the depot or the M1 (which was closed) were coned off
and shut. You didn't go a minute without seeing a police car driving
around! ![image](http://danielkennett.org/pictures/hemelfire/smoke.jpg)
On the way back home, we stopped at a field overlooking the nearby town
of St. Albans. From there, you can see the huge column of smoke rising
from the fire, going overhead and sinking down into the town, covering
it in a thick brown smog. A picture is below (click to enlarge), but you
really need to see the video for full effect!

Driving around St. Albans, you could smell the oil in the air. It's
caused havok as it settles down to land - everything had a thin film of
oil on it - the road, puddles, everything. Even after driving in the
smog for 30 minutes, my car was covered in a black coating of it.

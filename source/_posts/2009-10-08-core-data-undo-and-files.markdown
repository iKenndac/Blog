Core Data is awesome. One of the most awesome things about it is that
you get free undo/redo. Of course, you wouldn't actually *ship* anything
but the simplest of applications with the undo Core Data provides, but
getting it up to scratch it pretty simple — most of my additions in
[Clarus](http://www.kennettnet.co.uk/products/clarus/) are simply
putting certain operations into undo groups.

## Clarus and Files

Clarus can store photos and other resources in documents, and achieves
this by using a document bundle. A class, called
`KNBundledDocumentResourceManager`, manages what's going on:

-   When you first add a resource to a document, the file you add is
    copied into what's internally known as the *transient resources*
    directory. The location of this is an implementation detail, but
    current versions of Clarus use the current user's temporary
    directory.
-   If you then close the document without saving (or Revert back to the
    last saved version), the files still in the transient resources
    directory are simply cleared out.
-   If, instead, you save the document, the files in the transient
    resources directory are moved into the document's bundle.
-   The model doesn't know (or care) about all this, and just has the
    *resource id* of the file, asking the resource manager for the path
    whenever it's needed.

The transient resources directory is used so we don't fill up the
document's package with stuff until we're absolutely sure the user wants
it. This wouldn't actually be so bad back in the day, since we could
simply delete the file if it isn't wanted later on, but now we have
Spotlight and Time Machine indexing and backing up everything we do at
the file level, it's not so smart. Plus, we want the document's package
to be consistent with the saved state of the model at all times, just in
case the file is copied out from under us.

## Undo

For a piece about undo, I haven't really mentioned undo much so far,
have I? Well, that's because in Clarus 1.0.x, undo and redo doesn't
quite work correctly. You can undo and redo adding and removing
resources, but this doesn't actually affect the underlying files! So, if
you add a photo to your Clarus document in 1.0.x, pressing undo won't
remove the file from the resource manager and it'll end up in your
document's package no matter what. A while back, I was listening to
[Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com)'s "World According to Gemmell"
segment in the MDN show, and he was discussing how, basically, if you
allow the user to make an unrecoverable mistake, you fail. I heartily
agreed, and immediately added the following ticket into Clarus' issue
tracker:

> **Undoing adding/removing attachments and photos doesn't work
> correctly**

I'm happy to say that, almost exactly one month on from that ticket
being created, it's been marked as resolved and will be included in the
Clarus 1.5 release in a couple of weeks. The implementation hasn't been
as simple as I'd like, partly because of bad approaches on my part, and
partly because of a few... niggles in Cocoa that ended up frustrating me
somewhat:

> **After four hours of tedious bullshit from Cocoa, you can now
> undo/redo adding and deleting attached files from your document in
> Clarus.** *--iKenndac (me), on Twitter*

*As an aside, Geoff Pado's response to that cheered me up no end:*

> **@iKenndac You mean \*you\* can now, unless you already pushed an
> update? :P** *--Arclite, on Twitter*

### Bad Approach 1

"I know," I thought, "when you undo adding a photo, it'll just remove
it. Redoing will add the file again from its original location!" This is
immediately a bad idea, since Clarus' model is file ownership — once you
add a file to a Clarus document, Clarus makes its own copy and you can
trash the original file. Depending on you to *not* trash the file for
undo and redo to work properly is a fairly stupid way to work.

### Bad Approach 2

"Fine," I thought, "when you undo adding a photo, it'll move it to a new
place, reserved for removed items. Redoing will use the existing
mechanism of adding files, and the file will end up in the transient
resources queue. The existing save mechanism will move the file back to
the package on save." Under many situations, this works fine. However,
imagine the following sequence:

1.  User adds a photo, then saves the document. The document is marked
    clean, and the file is in the document's bundle.
2.  The user hits undo. The file is moved to the removed resources
    directory, and the document is marked as dirty.
3.  The user hits redo. The file is moved to the transient resources
    directory, and the document is marked clean again.

The failing point is step 3. The document is clean, but the file isn't
in the bundle! Hitting Save again will put the file back into the
bundle, but who hits Save on an unsaved document? At that point, the
user can close the document without prompts and lose their file.

### The Correct Approach

This is the approach Clarus 1.5 takes: Adding a photo works as in 1.0.x — the
file is first put into a transient directory, then moved to the
package upon save. When you remove a photo, either by undoing an add or
removing it using the Clarus UI, the file is kept in the package, but is
internally moved to a removed resources list. When you redo an add or
undo a remove, the file is put back into the current resources list.
Finally, when the user saves (or reverts), the resources in the
"removed" list are moved out to the transient resources directory and
put into the internal "transient removed resources" list, just in case
we want them back later. Hooray! Integrity is preserved!

## Implementation

The implementation is actually fairly simple, as long as you take into
account a few niggles. There are three methods in Clarus for adding and
removing photos. The first is called by whatever has the file path of
the original file to be added:

{% codeblock lang:objc %}
-(void)addImageFromPath:(NSString *)path {

    NSString *resourceId = [[[self document] resourceManager] addResourceFromPath:path];

    [[[self document] undoManager] beginUndoGrouping];

    Photo *photo = [imageController newObject]; 
    [photo setResourceId:resourceId];
    [imageController addObject:photo]; 
    [photo setDelegate:[[self document] resourceManager]];
    
    [[[[self document] undoManager] prepareWithInvocationTarget:self] removePhoto:photo withResourceId:resourceId]; 
    [[[self document] undoManager] endUndoGrouping];
}
{% endcodeblock %}


Fairly simple, right? This is what the code *does*:

1.  Adds the file to the resource manager. This copies the file to the
    right location and returns a resource id.
2.  Begins an undo grouping.
3.  Creates the photo object in the model, sets the resource id and
    delegate.
4.  Notifies the undo manager of how to undo this operation.
5.  Ends the undo grouping.

The `removePhoto:withResourceId:` method is simpler:

{% codeblock lang:objc %}
-(void)removePhoto:(Photo *)aPhoto withResourceId:(NSString *)resourceId {
    
    [[[self document] undoManager] beginUndoGrouping];
    
    [[[self document] resourceManager] removeResourceWithId:resourceId];
    [[aPhoto pet] removePhotosObject:aPhoto];

    [[[[self document] undoManager] prepareWithInvocationTarget:self] addPhoto:aPhoto withResourceId:resourceId];
    [[[self document] undoManager] endUndoGrouping];
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Finally, `addPhoto:withResourceId:` is just as simple:

{% codeblock lang:objc %}
-(void)addPhoto:(Photo *)aPhoto withResourceId:(NSString *)resourceId {

    [[[self document] undoManager] beginUndoGrouping];
    
    [[aPhoto pet] addPhotosObject:aPhoto];

    [[[[self document] undoManager] prepareWithInvocationTarget:self] removePhoto:aPhoto withResourceId:resourceId];
    [[[self document] undoManager] endUndoGrouping];
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Hopefully they're simple enough to understand without spelling it out.
Ideally, this is all we'd need to work properly, right? The resource
manager automatically moves a removed resource back to the correct list
(transient or current) when its path is requested.

### Hiccup 1

Notice that I'm passing the photo's resourceId around alongside the
photo. This seems a bit pointless since resourceId is a property of
photo, right? Well, we're wrapping another layer around Core Data's
built-in undo management, which means we get called *first*. This is
fine when undoing, but when redoing, we get called before Core Data gets
a chance to rebuild all of the data correctly. So, while we do get the
original photo instance on redo, *all of it's properties are nil*.
Therefore, we have to keep a separate reference to the resource id
throughout the process.

### Hiccup 2

This isn't actually shown in the code here, but is an artefact of how
the resource manager works. The resource manager has an instance of
`NSBundle` representing the document, and used to get paths using
`NSBundle`'s `pathForResource:ofType:` method. However, it would appear
that `NSBundle` caches the contents of the bundle. As resources are moved
in an out of the resources directory, NSBundle gets out of sync pretty
quickly, and `-pathForResource:ofType:` can return `nil` even though the
file is most definitely, positively there. To solve this, I eventually
stopped using `NSBundle`'s methods at all. `[[bundle resourcePath]
stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileName]` works much better.

## Visually

This approach really does require a separate controller to keep track of
what goes where and when. Consider this diagram of what's going on:

{% img center http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Untitled.png Clarus document resource diagram %}

Where a resource actually is depends on *four* things:

1.  Whether the document has been saved since the resource was added.
2.  Whether the resource has been removed since it was added.
3.  Where the user is in the undo stack.
4.  Whether the document is "clean" or not.

## Inherent Problems

My approach still has a couple of problems:

1.  Storing files in the user's temporary directory is fine, but if the
    document is on a different disk, moving the files around may take a
    long time.
2.  ~~At the moment, the removed resources directory is also the user's
    temporary directory, and files are moved there immediately when
    removed. This is actually wrong, since the package itself doesn't
    represent the last saved state any more - if you were to copy the
    document at this moment, the copy would be broken as some resources
    would be missing.~~ *The following has now been implemented:* This
    can be fixed by simply not moving files around when they're removed - only 
    when the document is saved. This allows the document package
    to keep its integrity *and* allow undo past the last save.

## Conclusion

Managing files and an undo stack while at the same time making sure the
document on disk keeps its integrity is a pain in the ass. I think my
approach is a good one, but if you disagree (or simply have another
approach), please leave a comment. The resource manager class is over
400 lines long and contains a ton of state information about which file
is where, where it came from and where it should go next. Relying on the
original file being there would make this a lot simpler. So would
allowing the document package to be inconsistent with the model itself
some of the time — let's face it, it's not like it's often a user would
add a file then hit undo given the lifespan of the document. However, as
Mike Lee said once (paraphrased): If you don't do a feature properly,
don't do it at all.

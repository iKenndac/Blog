Recently I went on holiday. Twice. The second trip was to Germany and France. I learned many things on this trip:

- The <a href="http://www.mazda.co.uk/showroom/rx-8/rx-8_r3/">RX-8 R3</a> is spades better on track than the original.

- <em>Catfights and Spotlights</em> is way better than <em>Taller in More Ways</em>.

- Actually, <em>Catfights and Spotlights</em> is a genuinely good album. 

- Oh God... I like the Sugababes. Bitch is changing me, man.

- After realising the above, a nervous listen to Counting Crows confirms I still like real music. Phew!

- The most ironic of all ironies is thinking "Wow, how do a ferry company operate charging Â£29 per ticket?", then finding out they've gone bust when you turn up to cross the channel.

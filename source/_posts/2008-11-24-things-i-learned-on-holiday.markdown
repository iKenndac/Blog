Recently I went on holiday. Twice. The second trip was to Germany and
France. I learned many things on this trip: - The [RX-8 R3](http://www.mazda.co.uk/showroom/rx-8/rx-8_r3/) is spades better on
track than the original. - *Catfights and Spotlights* is way better than
*Taller in More Ways*. - Actually, *Catfights and Spotlights* is a
genuinely good album. - Oh God... I like the Sugababes. Bitch is
changing me, man. - After realising the above, a nervous listen to
Counting Crows confirms I still like real music. Phew! - The most ironic
of all ironies is thinking "Wow, how do a ferry company operate charging
Â£29 per ticket?", then finding out they've gone bust when you turn up to
cross the channel.

So, I quite often make fun of my girlfriend - especially of her car, a
[Ford Ka](http://www.ford.co.uk/ka). There's nothing wrong with it per
s√©, but it's quite a lot slower than my car. Anyway, today I'm going to
Portsmouth (about 90 miles away) and she's going to work (about 2 miles
away from her) and it turns out that we're leaving our respective homes
at around the same time. I joked "Ha, I'll still arrive before you!" and
immediately got to work on the prank. The premise was that Google Maps
has introduced a "Choose your Vehicle" feature, that'll adjust your
journey time based on the performance of the chosen vehicle. Here's the
resulting journey to her work in my car: ![RX-8 Journey time](http://danielkennett.org/pictures/GooglePrank-RX8.png) ... and in
hers: ![RX-8 Journey time](http://danielkennett.org/pictures/GooglePrank-Ka.png) Needless to
say, she fell for it - being annoyed that Google would've got the data
for her car so wrong. The best comment: "According to that i drive an
RX8 to work and uni!" Prank successful! Oh, and she'll never forgive me
for this.

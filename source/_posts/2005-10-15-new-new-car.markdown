Ok, so the Astra wasn't working out. Well, it *was*, but my business is
going well and I can afford something a bit sportier. I had an Astra VXR
on order - the same basic car as mine, but with a 240bhp 2 litre turbo
engine in it. I was giving my friend Michelle a lift somewhere one day,
and we saw an RX-8 drive past. I started telling her about how I'd
always wanted one, etc, but how I couldn't because it's a rear-wheel
drive sports car and I'm too young. "How is it different from the
Astra?" she said, "It's the same power, and not that much more
expensive." Interesting point. Two days later, I'd put an order down for
one. A couple of weeks after that, I was driving round in a sexy new
RX-8, with all the trimmings! At first, I was a bit anxious about
swapping that new Astra for this, but after driving it a bit, I can
honestly say that the RX-8 is more than the Astra was ever going to be.

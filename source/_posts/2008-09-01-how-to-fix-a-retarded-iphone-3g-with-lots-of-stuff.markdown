A while ago, I was having signal problems with my iPhone, and wrote
about it in my post ["How to fix a retarded iPhone with masking tape"](http://danielkennett.org/blog/2008/02/how-to-fix-a-retarded-iphone-with-masking-tape/). Since then, I've replaced it
with an iPhone 3G. Much to my (and lots of other people's) annoyance,
the iPhone 3G no longer supports charging on the 12V power pins in the
dock cable - only the 5V USB ones. This is a problem when I want to use
my C30's built-in iPod connection - it'll still allow access to the
iPhone's music through the stereo menu, but it's pretty useless 'cause
I'll end up with a flat battery.

So! Time to make something that fixes
the problem. Unfortunately, the iPhone is really pernickety about
charging - you can't just give it 5V over the USB power pins - it needs
the voltages on the USB data pins that'd be present on a high-speed USB
bus before it accepts the charge.  This is the finished product:

**Important Information**

First, be **VERY VERY CAREFUL**. You're
messing with electronics that supply a very expensive phone from a
probably very expensive car! Shorts *will* damage your device - my iPod
nano no longer charges over USB because I decided to see what happened
when you put 12V up the 5V USB power pin.

Second, someone is coming out
with a [better product](http://www.cablejive.com/iphone_3g_charge_converter.html) than
this fairly soon - this is just here for interest's sake. For instance,
the device made below kicks out quite a lot of heat due to the voltage
regulator used, and is quite bulky because of the heat sink used. If you
still want to go ahead, read on... 

**What You'll Need**

-   Soldering iron, solder and at least some skill with soldering small
    electronics
-   [Strip board](http://www.maplin.co.uk/module.aspx?ModuleNo=1917&doy=1m9)
    with at least six lanes
-   1 x [12v -\> 5v voltage regulator](http://www.maplin.co.uk/Search.aspx?criteria=CH35) with
    heatsink (marked CH35 on the diagram below)
-   2 x 50kohm resistor
-   1 x 150kohm resistor
-   1 x 100kohm resistor
-   Thin wire in black and red
-   Heat shrink (I used electrical tape, but heat shrink is better)
-   A project box to put it all in
-   An [iPod dock extension cable](http://www.cablejive.com/extendercable.html)
-   A multimeter for testing

**Circuit Diagram**

Below is a diagram of what we'll be doing - pulling
the 12V feed from the dock extension cable, regulating it down to 5V and
injecting it down the 5V USB feed. At the same time, the USB D+/- feeds
will be bridged to the 5V+ and ground feeds to simulate the voltages of
a USB high speed bus to make the iPhone pick up the charge. Click for a
much bigger and clearer version.

**Extracting The Feeds**

The first thing we need to do is find and
extract the needed feeds from the dock extension cable, while keeping
the rest of the feeds intact to preserve the quality of the data and
audio going through the cable. First, strip a few inches of sheathing
from the cable at your desired location.

[{% img center http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_3925.jpg "Stripping the sheathing" %}](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_3925.jpg)

Next, cut a slit along the braiding that surrounds the inner feeds and
leave a couple of centimetres at each end twisted up - we'll join them
back together with a wire later.

[{% img center http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_3927.jpg Feeds %}](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_3927.jpg)

Next, we need to find the feeds we need to work with. Visit the
[iPod Dock Connector pinouts reference](http://pinouts.ru/Devices/ipod_pinout.shtml)
on pinouts.ru
and study it carefully. The numbers on my diagram above refer to the pin
numbers in that document. Take the cover off the female connector on
your extension wire and *carefully* study the colours of the wires,
using a multimeter to check the voltages. Here are the colours of the
wires in my cable, but **DO NOT** copy these - they'll most probably be
different in your cable. 

- Dark Blue: 29+30. Firewire Ground
- Brown: 19+20. Firewire +12VDC
- Black: 16. USB ground
- Brown with white stripes: 23. USB +5VDC
- Black with white stripes: 27. USB Data+
- Light green: 25. USB Data-

Cut the Firewire ground and Firewire +12VDC wires at the iPod end of the
cable, so you have two long wires coming from the car end. Cut the rest
of the needed wires (all those listed above) at the car end, giving long
wires coming from the iPod end. This gives you essentially double the
length of sheathing you stripped to work with, which'll make things lots
easier!

**Putting it all Together**

After a few test runs (pushing the components onto your strip board) 
double and triple-checking your
design, solder the components into place. Once done, connect the two
braiding stubs we cut off earlier with a black wire - this is an
important grounding wire, and needs to be electrically sound. Once done,
you should have something like this:

[{% img center http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_3979.jpg Completed Board %}](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_3979.jpg)

**Please Note** that it is very important that you have an adequate heat
sink in place if you're using a similar voltage regulator to the one I
have here. These things kick out a *lot* of heat. If the regulator
overheats, you'll hear the audio from the iPhone go very distorted as it
starts sending 12V down the 5V line. **PROVIDE ADEQUATE COOLING!!!**

**Finishing Off** 

Before you connect your modded cable to your computer
or your car, find a Firewire-\>Dock cable, connect your cable to it and
use a multimeter to verify the correct voltages are being send up the
cable to the iPod. Compared to ground, the voltages should be:

- USB +5VDC: ~+5V 
- USB Data+: ~+2V
- USB Data-: s~+2.5V 

Once you've verified
the voltages are correct, connect an iPod to the iPod end of your cable.
It should charge. Finally, go down to your car and check it works there
- the iPhone should charge and still work with any integration features.
If it doesn't, disconnect it immediately and check your design. Now it
works, package it up inside the project box.

Enjoy your iPhone 3G!

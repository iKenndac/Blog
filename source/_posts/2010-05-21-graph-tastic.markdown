I've haven't been
[shy](http://danielkennett.org/2010/02/playing-the-game%E2%80%A6-and-losing/)
about sharing my personal financial difficulties on this blog. However,
one thing I was worried about was that my financial troubles were being
caused by fundamental cracks in the foundations of my company. The
year's accounts have just been completed, and I'm very relieved to find
out that isn't the case. Allow me to present a *graph* to demonstrate.

2006-7 was a bumper year, but other than that, it's all nice and flat.
Phew! However, let's take a look at my pay (not on the same scale as the
above graph):

Well, that'd explain *that*, then. The increased pressure on the company
caused by the failure of the GeoCachr project means there's less spare
money to pay me with. I choose that wording carefully — as my bank
manager once very succinctly put it, I get paid last. This company has
obligations to its customers, HMRC, its creditors and staff. If there's
any money left over for me, hooray! — I get paid. If not, well, sucks to
be me. The fact my pay is more than zero means the company has spare
cash, and that's a good thing. The fact that the company's income has
been stable for three consecutive years is also a good thing.

### Detail

So, let's have a look at my company's cashflow in a bit more detail.
First, month to month, bearing in mind my company year runs March-Feb:

Not much to report here. As normal, my best months were December and
January. As normal, my worst month was February. Next!

![2009-10, PayPal vs HSBC](http://danielkennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/PayPalVHSBC.png)

I find this graph *very*interesting. At the top of the payment details
page on my store, it says:

> *Please enter your card details below, or click here to pay with
> PayPal.*

When the user clicks to pay with PayPal, the card number fields
disappear and the payment will be done with PayPal instead of my card
provider, HSBC. Over the whole year, only 18.7% of my income was done
through PayPal. PayPal's *reason* for existing is to provide customers
with a "trusted" company to place payments through. If you take this
data at face value (which would be stupid, I'll admit), it would suggest
that over 80% of my customers would rather type their credit card
details into *my*site and trust *me* than trust PayPal.

Now, I dislike PayPal. They're more expensive than HSBC for processing
payments, and they do a bunch of stupid stuff *all* the time. I don't
trust them, and never keep more than a few hundred pounds in my account
at any one time. This data may suggest that I'm not alone in disliking
PayPal. However, I'm not going to remove PayPal from my site — 19% of my
income was through them, which isn't an insignificant number.

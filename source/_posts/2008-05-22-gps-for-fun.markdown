These days, when you talk about GPS people tend to think of the TomTom
type of GPS unit that takes your car to the right place. However, GPS
can be used to have fun, too. I've had a basic GPS unit on my mountain
bike for a while - a [Garmin Foretrex 201](https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=257). It's a fairly basic
black and white unit that I used mainly as a trip computer to keep track
of how far I'd gone, etc. It doesn't have any maps, but does plot where
you've been so once you've gone to some places and added waypoints, it's
useful for getting around.

However, what it isn't very good for is exploring new places. Recently,
my girlfriend got a new bike and we found a massive area of... *land* to
explore, full of lakes and canals and forests and things - and, more
importantly, paths that criss-cross the whole area. The first time we
went out, I noted on Google maps where we'd enter the area and where we
wanted to go - North East-ish until we hit the canal. The ride was fun,
but we had to pretty much stick to going NE and didn't really know how
far it was to the canal. During that week, I invested in a new GPS unit
- the [Garmin Colorado 300](http://www.garmin.com/products/colorado300/), along with a bike
mount and detail topographical maps of Britain. The unit is designed for
offroad persuits, and while you can load road maps onto it and use it
for road navigation, you can get better units for that for less money.
What this unit *excels* at is offroad persuits. The unit is much larger
than my old one, but actually mounts onto my bike even better than the
small one did - tucking into the stem with only minor relocation of my
light ((My light used to be in the same place, but standing on top of
the handlebars)), the area least likely to be attacked by trees and
rocks when I'm going through tight spaces or falling off (both of which
happen regularly!):

On the trail, the unit is amazing. As you can see from the screenshots
below, you can zoom right in and view the landscape detail all around
you, including trails and paths. The black route on the shots is the
route we took:

This information while you're out and about is simply wonderful -
especially in new places. We had lots more fun out with this unit than
before - in that area of countryside, we found a horse racing track, a
small hill with a tower on top where you could watch jet planes land
onto the nearby airstrip and some great biking trails. Finally, of
interest, the unit also supports
[Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/), which looks like a great new
activity to get in to!

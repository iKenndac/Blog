Unfortunately, my office is located in a very small mobile phone signal
blackspot as it's nestled at the bottom of a small hill — move a few
metres away outside and signal returns to normal. Recently, Vodafone
released a little device called the [Sure Signal](http://online.vodafone.co.uk/dispatch/Portal/appmanager/vodafone/wrp?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=templateCClamp&pageID=PPP_0161)
— a mini cell tower (femtocell) that provides your phone with signal.

Pretty much
[anywhere](http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/4620/vodafone-sure-signal-femtocell-box)
you see a Sure Signal review, you'll see comments talking about
Vodafone's evil plans for ripping off the consumer by charging extra to
supply their service over the customer's internet connection. Well, I
managed to use a SUPER SECRET method to get my Sure Signal absolutely
free.

1.  First, I didn't bitch and complain about it on some internet forum.
2.  Next, I phoned Vodafone's customer services and explained my
    situation, pointing out that it's a bit crappy that I can't use my
    phone at work.
3.  There's no step three!

At no point did I have to argue or get annoyed. The guy I spoke to in
customer services was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my problem.
Less than 24 hours later, I have full 3G signal in my office.

I'm sharing this SUPER SECRET information with you, the casual surfer,
so you might be able to get a Sure Signal for free as well.
